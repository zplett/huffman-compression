1. Zac Plett and Ezra Goss

2. Our programs ( encode.c and decode.c ) can be used to encode information using a Huffman Tree or
   decode input encoded information.

3. Files:
	- list.c: Contains our list, tree and node structures and the related functionality of
	  	  the Huffman Trees.
	- list.h: The header file for methods and structs used within list.c, encode.c, and decode.c.
	- decode.c: Executable used to decode an encoded Huffman Tree.
	- decode.h: Header file for methods within decode.c.
	- encode.c: Executable used to encode information with Huffman's algorithm.
	- encode.h: Header file for methods within encode.c.

4. There are no known bugs and all functionality is complete.

5. We spent an estimated 12 hours working on this lab.

6. Interesting design choices: index out of bounds error on list traversal returns the tail, tried to encapsulate all input logic in a few functions to simulate the ability to read in bit by bit in the rest of our program.

7. There are currently no valgrind errors or warnings. 

We affirm that we have adhered to the honor code on this assignment.
